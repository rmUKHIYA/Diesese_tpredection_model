# Machine Learning Models for Disease Prediction

This repository contains three separate machine learning models developed using **Jupyter Notebook** to predict diseases:

1. **Diabetes Prediction Model**
2. **Heart Disease Prediction Model**
3. **Parkinsonâ€™s Disease Prediction Model**

## ðŸ”§ Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-Learn
- pickle
- joblib
- Jupyter Notebook

## ðŸ“Œ Project Structure
Each disease prediction model is developed independently in a separate Jupyter Notebook.

## ðŸ“Š Models Overview
- The models are trained using machine learning algorithms on publicly available datasets.
- Data preprocessing, feature selection, and model evaluation are performed within each notebook.

## ðŸ’¡ Future Enhancements
- Improve model accuracy with hyperparameter tuning.
- Deploy models as a web application for user interaction.
- Add more diseases for prediction.
